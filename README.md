This project was developed over the course of Semester 3 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science.

This is a software product designed for managing a retail store. With a streamlined and intuitive design, it provides features such as product display, editing, and filtering, as well as cart management.

The graphical interface was developed using the Qt framework. I employed object-oriented programming concepts such as layered architecture and data encapsulation.

Here is a video demo of the product:
